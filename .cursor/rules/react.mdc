# React Development Guidelines

## React 19 Features
- Leverage React 19's new features when appropriate
- Use functional components exclusively
- Implement proper error boundaries around components that might fail

## Component Structure
- Start with imports
- Then TypeScript interfaces for props and state
- Next component definition with function declaration
- Hooks at the top of the component body
- Helper functions next
- Return JSX at the end

## State Management
- Use React hooks for local state
- Initialize state with sensible defaults
- Group related state with useReducer when appropriate
- Use controlled components for form inputs

## Event Handling
- Use properly typed event handlers
- Prefer inline arrow functions for simple handlers
- Extract complex handlers to named functions
- Ensure proper event cleanup in useEffect

## Performance
- Use React.memo for components that render often with the same props
- Apply useMemo for expensive calculations
- Use useCallback for functions passed to child components

## TypeScript
- Define explicit interfaces for component props
- Use type unions when appropriate
- Properly type event handlers and state
- Avoid any when possible
