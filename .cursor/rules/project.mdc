# ChronoLingua - Natural Date Parsing Demo

## Project Overview
- This is a Next.js application that demonstrates natural language date parsing in multiple languages
- Uses Sugar.js for date parsing across different locales
- Built with React 19, Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Shadcn UI components
- Implements responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Code Style and Structure
- Use TypeScript with strict typing for all code
- Follow functional component patterns with React hooks
- Maintain clean component structure with clear separation of concerns
- Use descriptive variable names that indicate purpose

## Component Guidelines
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable UI elements into the `components/ui` directory
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the established naming conventions in the project

## State Management
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local component state
- Props should be properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
- Avoid prop drilling by using composition when appropriate

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize React renders by properly memoizing components when needed
- Ensure responsive design works across different device sizes
